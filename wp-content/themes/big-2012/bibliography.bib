	The second goal is to present visual and haptic sensation simultaneously
	by using a single device that doesn't oblige the user to wear any
	extra equipment. In order to achieve these goals, we designed a new
	interface device comprising of a flexible screen, an actuator array
	and a projector. The actuator deforms the flexible screen onto which
	the image is projected. The user can then touch the image directly
	and feel its shape and rigidity. Initially we fabricated two prototypes,
	and their effectiveness is examined by studying the observations
	made by anonymous users and a performance evaluation test for spatial

	that support systematic design of transparent tactile information
	display; and we frame the advances required to realize significant
	benefits with the technology we have now. Examples used and objectives

  abstract = {Airborne Ultrasound Tactile Display (AUTD), which is developed in
	our laboratory, can provide tactile sensation in midair using acoustic
	radiation pressure without any equipment attached on your hands.
	It can create various stimulus patterns in arbitrary point by steering
	the focal point using a linear phased array. However, its generating
	power is only 1.6 #x00D7;10-2 N and the "arbitrary point" is limited
	to a small space, so there is a need for advancement of its performance.
	To avoid these weaknesses of AUTD, we try to realize a large aperture
	of array by synchronized multiple AUTD units. In this paper, we describe
	the detail of the proposed method, the numerical simulation for determine
	the arrangement of AUTD units, and newer prototype now under construction.},

	system combines electromagnetic actuation with permanent
	
	magnets attached to the user’s hand. FingerFlux lets users
	
	feel the interface before touching, and can create both attract-
	
	ing and repelling forces. This enables applications such as
	
	reducing drifting, adding physical constraints to virtual con-
	
	trols, and guiding the user without visual output. We show
	
	that users can feel vibration patterns up to 35 mm above our
	
	table, and that FingerFlux can signiﬁcantly reduce drifting
	
	when operating on-screen buttons without looking.},
